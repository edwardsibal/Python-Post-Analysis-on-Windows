# Python-Post-Analysis-on-Windows
This repository contains Python code that automates my day-to-day repetitive tasks for post analysis.  Cross-functional teams tend to change features in firmware and/or mechanics, and they request to repeat a test to see if their new implementation in code or mechanics has any side effects to the hard drive system.  These scripts help me become efficient in my work, as I can focus on developing more test code.  

About the files:
These Python scripts automate Windows tasks to automatically: 
1) Create multiple folders with a specified folder name (mkdir_file.py)
2) Delete unnecessary files in a directory (deleteFiles.py)
3) Call an Excel Macro function and apply the macro to all associated .csv files (CallMacroExcel.py)

...More to come!
